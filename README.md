  *description*:This project is a Python-based file encryption and decryption tool that uses AES-256 encryption via the cryptography libraryâ€™s Fernet module. It provides a                   simple command-line interface for securely managing sensitive files.

ðŸ§© Core Features:
Key Generation: Creates a strong 256-bit symmetric key and stores it in a .key file.

File Encryption: Encrypts any file (e.g., .txt, .pdf, .docx) and saves it with a .enc extension.

File Decryption: Decrypts .enc files and restores the original content as a .dec file.

User-Friendly CLI: Easy-to-navigate terminal menu for all operation
